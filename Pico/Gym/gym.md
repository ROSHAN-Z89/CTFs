There was a pdf file I had to download.
Used exiftool to extract the metadata of th pdf file
The author name was a bit suspicious "cGljb0NURntwdXp6bDNkX20zdGFkYXRhX2YwdW5kIV9jMjA3MzY2OX0="
It is basically a Base64 encoded text
Used cyberchef.io to decode the ciper 
Flag = picoCTF{puzzl3d_m3tadata_f0und!_c2073669}

The author name was the flag
